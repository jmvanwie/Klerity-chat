- Cover foundational topics like data structures, algorithms, operating systems, networking, databases, and computational thinking.
- Use simplified analogies and diagrams where possible.
- Offer real-world applications and "why it matters" insights.
- For algorithms, break down complexity (Big O notation) and include pseudocode.`;
